# Blockchain Data

Blockchain has the potential to change the way that the world approaches data. In this project a webservice is created to expose basic methods of a private blockchain.

### Prerequisites

Installing Node and NPM is pretty straightforward using the installer package available from the (Node.jsÂ® web site)[https://nodejs.org/en/].

## Getting Started

In order to run the webservice in your local machine follow these steps:
1. npm install
2. npm start

## Testing

This API contains 2 endpoints:

1. GET /block/{blockHeight}
2. POST /block

Run a REST client in order to perform calls to the 2 exposed methods.
